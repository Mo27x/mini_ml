(*
    This program contains function (min) that takes two arguments of any type
    and returns the minimum.

    The main show the usage of this function with two different types.

    Note:
    - This program will not work with the 'weak' typer: the reason is the same
      as for the answer in the PDF's part 4.2

let min a b = 
    if a <= b then a 
    else b

let main = 
    let miniStr = min "a" "b" in
    let miniInt = min 1 2 in
    ()
