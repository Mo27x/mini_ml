(*
  This program shows that our typers catch some typing errors
  (the type of the variables, not writting mistakes obviously)

  In this case the error is that the constant 1 of type TInt is used as a 
  condition in an 'if ... then ... else' expression which adds a constraint 
  on it which can't be satisfied. 
  (a TInt can't be a TBool, we're not writting mini-c !)

let main = if 1 then true else false
